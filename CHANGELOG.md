POST /users/v1/cross-progression/disable
- Description changed from 'Disable Cross Progression for the player associated with the platform identity.  
While cross progression is disabled, all linked users who login will receive a token for the player associated 
with their platform user.

If an identity is not provided, the identity in the token will be used.

If you are modifying a user outside of your person, Required Permissions:

- For any user (including themselves) any of: `user:*`, `user:modify:any`



NOTE: Whenever you change the link or cross progression status of a user, it is recommended to 
refresh their access token.  Each token does container user information, which may be incorrect after a link or 
cross progression change.  There is no guarantee that calling other endpoints will operate on the correct user
until the token has been refreshed.' to 'Disable Cross Progression for a person.  While cross progression is disabled, 
all linked users who login will receive a token for the player associated with their platform user.
    
The person is found using the following priority:

1. If the `person_id` is provided directly
2. If the `platform` and `platform_user_id` are provided, the `person_id` of that platform user is used.
3. If the Authorization header contains a user token, the platform and platform user id from the token are used and the person associated with that user is used.

If you are modifying a user outside of your person, Required Permissions:

- For any user (including themselves) any of: `user:*`, `user:modify:any`



NOTE: Whenever you change the link or cross progression status of a user, it is recommended to 
refresh their access token.  Each token does container user information, which may be incorrect after a link or

GET /inventory/v1/catalog
- Description changed from 'Get the entire catalog.' to 'Get the entire catalog.

This endpoint endpoint is generally discouraged outside of prototyping and early development.  It's not that the endpoint won't function, but rather that it creates a pattern that may result in a poor end user experience.  It has etag/if-none-match handling, but it is for the entire catalog.  So if a single byte changes inside the catalog (e.g. turning on a loot record, adding a single new item, changing a price point, adjusting the threshold to hit level X in an XP Table), then the etag will change.  If clients are re-requesting data from this endpoint, then those changes will result in them re-downloading, and re-parsing the entire catalog for that tiny modification.

Early on in a game's lifecycle, this doesn't matter much - since catalog data is pretty small.  But as your game grows, and you create lots of things to receive/purchase/grant, the data will balloon in size.  Parsing the response does occur on unreal's main thread, and with a sufficiently large catalog, you may see hitches.  There will also be lots of data in there that may not even be necessary for your client to see at all (e.g. if you only grant the loot from the dedicated server or if an item is just a tracker, it doesn't necessarily need to be visible on the client).

We generally encourage having a well-known list of vendors to request from `/inventory/v1/catalog/vendor/{vendor_id}`, and then requesting the entire set of xp tables, price points, and bucket rulesets (as those are generally pretty small lists).  That list of vendors could come from anywhere, it could be hardcoded, be set from an ini (if your client is unlikely to need arbitrary vendor additions, but you want to retain the ability to patch it) or it could come down in a kv.'
